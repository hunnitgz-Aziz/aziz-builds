Bringing creative coding to the physical space and introducing myself into visual DJ'ing.

Museache and I teamed up to work with NJ's up and coming music festival, Madliberation. Museache contributed stage design and stage management for a weekend of 48 hours of non-stop music. Our main focus for stage design and management was to come up with a structure that'll prevent rain from damaging all equipment on the stage from the rainstorm we faced.

On top of that I had a crazy itch to test my abilities and create a wall with windows to display some awesome graphics I can toggle through. So I teamed up Bldy Rxse' fashion and visual designer, Kwabena Boachie to splash some of the animations that he had stashed in the vault.

We had just a little over 48 hours prior to the first performance on Friday to complete this mission.

#### The Exhibiton

The final touch to the stage added life to the performances late at night. How was it made? A truck load of 1/4" plywood sheets to cover the studs that held the wall and some bedsheets for screens. The visual DJ set up was a mere node.js Gulp starter app with a drag-and-resize tool that allowed me to move the videos as I pleased. Note: I had to make this before landing on the campgrounds because there was neither cellular nor internet connnecion. Lastly, just a projector to beam Kwabena's graphics on the wall.
