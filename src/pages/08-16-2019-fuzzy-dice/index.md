I really have an interest in making pet furniture. Having a cat I get to analyze what he likes to lay in, play with or scratch. My hypothesis: a giant fuzzy dice. Kamaal can spend his time in here and have a spot in the house. Unfortunately my hypothesis was incorrect. He did not like it one bit!

This was a fun project to go through either way. The process always beats the outcome.

Special shoutout to my friend Jackie for sewing the seams for me. That kind of detailing made a huge difference to the overall finish.
