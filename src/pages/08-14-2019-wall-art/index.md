Kayleigh, a friend of mine was doing some living room renovations and needed to fill the blank wall above her main couch. I was pretty stoked when she asked me to do it because I really wanted to use my new Microgrip table saw jig. Following the request, I spent the next 3 weeks digging for some cool looking scrap wood.
